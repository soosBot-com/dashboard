# soosBot Dashboard
This is the front-end react app of soosBot's [Dashboard](https://dash.soosbot.com). The Backend ([api.soosBot.com](https://api.soosbot.com)) is currently not on GitHub, as it will be non-open-source, but is hosted on Repl.it and can be viewed, as Repl.it is open source defaultly. (Good luck finding it).


# Hosting/Running
I don't want anyone running this, but if you are too dumb to code a client-side react app, here's how to do it. 

#### Download the required node modules

```js
npm install
```

#### After downloading the node packages, run the command below to get a build folder containing static files.
```js
npm run build
```
#### After you have a folder with static files, use an [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/) or [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) server to host them. The last step would be making the 404 error return index.html. This is so that react-router-dom works on a static server. (GFYS for running)
